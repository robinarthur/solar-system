# solar-system
This is my attempt at makinging a custom solar system in python with realistic physics. The standout feature is the first person view mode from the spaceship that you control. You must have pygame installed to run this script.

Controls:

Thrusting - WASD
Increased thrust - SHIFT (hold)
Decreased thrust - SPACE (hold)
Switch between view modes - v
Move camera angle: mouse

While in first person view:

Switch focussed body - f
Lock view on focussed body - r

While in top-down view:

Zoom in: PAGE UP
Zoom out: PAGE DOWN
